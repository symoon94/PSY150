## Sex Differences in Intelligence
- average IQ equal across gender, but variability is different...

## Possible Biases in Intelligence Testing

1. <u>test content</u> may require cultural knowledge
    - culture-fair IQ tests: attempt to find content that is culture- and language-neural (difficult!)

2. <u>cultural expectations</u> may be biased
    - stereotype: socially shared beliefs about a group & its members
        - Teen Talk Barbie (introduced 2/1992, recalled 10/92)
            - "Math is tough!"

    - stereotype threat:
        - cultural stereotypes "in the air"
        - may affect performance negatively (even without interacting with biased person)

    - 3 steps to stereotype threat:
        1. stereotype awareness -> self-threat
        2. self-threat -> anxiety about confirming the stereotype
        3. anxiety -> poorer performance

## Steele & Aronson (1995)
- __IVs__: Black/White participants completed items from the verbal GRE
    - test framed as diagnostic/not diagnostic of innate IQ

- __DVs__: # of items correct

## Spencer, Steele, & Quinn (1999)
> women and math
- __IVs__: <u>men/women</u> take math test that <u>produces/does not produce</u> gender differences
- __DVs__: math test performance

## Stereotype Threat
- 300+ stereotype threat papers published, in a variety of domains:
    - __educational domains__
        - racial minorities & academic performance
        - women & math
        - SES & academic performance
    - __non-educational domains__
        - race & sports
        - gender & business negotiation
        - gender & emotional expression
        - gender & driving
        - old age & memory

- __Bottom line__: stereotype threat is a general psychological process that can affect <u>any</u> group for whom negative stereotypes exist.

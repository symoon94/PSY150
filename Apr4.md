## Evaluating Psychoanalysis: __The Bad__
- ___scientific shortcomings__
    - based on Freud's memories & interpretations, not empirical evidence
    - fails to predict behaciors, only explains them _post hoc_ (testable predictions?)
    - __modern research refutes many of Freud's idea:__
        - little evidence for repression

## Evaluating Psychoanalysis: __The Good__
- introduction of the unconscious
    - __modern definition fo unconscious:_ processing of which we are not aware
        - e.g. implicit learning, implicit memory, blind spot, reflexes, etc.
    - different than Freud's concept, but rooted in that idea
- defense against anxiety, often unconsciously
- first personality & psychotherapy theories

    - first need to describe personality (vs. explaining)

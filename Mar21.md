# Motivation & Emotion

## What Is Motivation?

- Motivation: need or desire that energizes & directs behavior
    - can be biological, cognitive, social, etc.

## 4 sources of Motivation
1. instincts: biologically-determined behaciors essential to survival
- earily explanation for human motivation, but...
    - How many instincts are there?
    - How does the "instinct" label promote understanding?
    - What about learned motives?

2. drive-reduction theory
    - physiological needs -> <u>drive</u> to meet those needs
        - motivated to restore homeostasis (balance of body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.)

3. optimum arousal theory: desire to avoid stimuli that are too boring or too stimulating
    - best performance at intermediate level of arousal
    - predicts preferences for patterns, art, music, etc.

4. priorities among needs
- Abraham Maslow
    - hierarchy of needs: fundamental needs (bottom of pyramid) need to be met before moving up
    - self-actualization: realizing one's potential

## Physiological Influences on Hunger

- feedback from stomach, intestines, liver
- brain monitors glucose levels (hypothalamus)
    - _filling rat's stomach with saltwater reduces hunger less than milk_

## Hypothalamus & hunger

1. lateral hypothalamus initiates hunger
    - stimulation -> hunger
    - lesioned -> no interest in food

2. ventromedial hypothalamus hypothalamus suppresses hunger
    - stimulation -> stop eating
    - lesioned -> continuous eating

- set point theory: hypothalamus strives to maintain optimum body weight (set point)
- eating produces leptin (hormone released by fat cells)
    - <u>__leptin__</u> level and <u>__hunger__</u> are negatively correlated.

Psychological Influences on Hunger
- e.g. memory of last meal
- e.g. jealousy???

## obesity

- obesity: Body Mass Index (BMI) score greater than 30

### Why Does Obesity Happen?

1. "obese personality" that cannot resist eating?
    - little to no evidence
        - exception = "fidget factor"?
2. __genes?__
    - strong evidenve for genetic component
    - <u>serotonin</u> involved with feeling full
        - mice without certain serotonin receptors -> __obesity__
        - serotonin receptroe blocks in humans -> __weight gain__
    - gene "ob" controls release of __leptin__
        - more fat = more leptin
        - gene maintains constant level of body fat
    - defective ob gene -> obesity

3. __environment factors?__
    - e.g. fast food, more sedentary activities, etc.
    - high cultural variability in obesity

## Eating Disorders: Anorexia Nervosa

- refused to maintain even low normal weight
    - intense fear of gaining weight
    - body image distortion
    - obsessive thinking about food

- most common among adolescents
    - 90% of cases = female

## Eating Disorders: Bulimia Nervosa

- binge eating -> guilt&depression -> attempt to prevent weight gain
    - __purging type__: intentional vomiting, laxatives
    - __non-purging type__: fasting, excessive exercise

- most common among women in late teens - early 20s

## Why Do Eating Disorders Happen?

- biological explanations:

    - __genes__
        - if one twin has a disorder, how often does the other? (concordance rate)

    - __serotonin levels__
        - anorexia -> high levels
        - bulimia -> low levels

- social/cultural explanations:
    - e.g. social expectations
        - _Fredrickson et al. (1998)_:
            - __IVs__:
                - <u>__men/women__</u> wore <u>__sweater/swimsuit__</u> while taking math test (privately)
            - __DVs__:
                - feelings about own body (compared to pretrest)
                - math test score
            - __results__: women&swimsuit -> only group to inrease in body shame, revulsion, disgust with themselves

- culture -> idealized body images
    - ___Lever (2003)___: 9 in 10 women would rather have perfect body than mate with perfect body
        - __only 4 in 10 men say the same ....__

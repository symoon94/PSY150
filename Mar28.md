# 3 Stages of Prenatal Development
1. ___zygote___: fertilized egg
    - 23 pairs of chromosomes;
    1/2 of each pair from egg (x), 1/2 from sperm (X or Y)
        - XX => female
        - XY => male
    - by 1 week: ~100 cells
        - ___cellular differentiation___
    - by 10-14 days: zygote attaches to uterine wall
        - outer layer -> placenta
        - inner layer -> ___embryo___

2. ___embryo___
    - weeks 2-8
    - major axis of body forms
    - 1st signs of organ development
        - e.g. heart begins to beat

3. ___fetus___
    - 9 weeks -> birth
    - by 6th month: organs developed enough to (possibly) survive premature birth
    - sensitive to both light and sound

        #### The Learning Petus
        - ___DeCasper & Fifer (1980)___ : read ___cat in the Hat___ aloud 2x daily for 6 weeks before giving birth
            - immediately after birth: babies given headphones, pacifier-like device
            - speed of pacifier sucking = hearing mom's voice vs. another woman
                - chose speed that produced mom's voice
                - chose speed that produced mom's ___Cat in the Hat___ cs. another story

# Threats to Prenatal Development: ___Environment & Genetics___
- __environmental threats__
    - teratogen: agent that causes birth defects
        - ___e.g. hormones___
            - ___cortisol___ : stress hormone
                - high cortisol levels during pregnancy
                    -> growth genes operate slower
        - ___e.g. viruses___
        - ___e.g. radiation___
        - ___e.g. drug use___
            - nicotine -> lower birth weight, greater risk of SIDS
            - alcohol -> Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
                - intellectual disability, memory/attention deficits, stunted growth, facial abnormalities
- __genetic threats__
    - __Down syndrome (aka. trisomy 21)__
        - caused by 3rd copy of 21st chromosome
            - heart/eye/ear defects
            - sleep apnea
            - poor muscle tone, short limbs
            - facial abnormalities
            - intellectual disability (avg. IQ = 50-55)
        - 1 in 800-1000 births

## 3 Stages of Prenatal Development
1. ___zygote___: fertilized egg
    - 23 pairs of chromosomes;
    1/2 of each pair from egg (x), 1/2 from sperm (X or Y)
        - XX => female
        - XY => male
    - by 1 week: ~100 cells
        - ___cellular differentiation___
    - by 10-14 days: zygote attaches to uterine wall
        - outer layer -> placenta
        - inner layer -> ___embryo___

2. ___embryo___
    - weeks 2-8
    - major axis of body forms
    - 1st signs of organ development
        - e.g. heart begins to beat

3. ___fetus___
    - 9 weeks -> birth
    - by 6th month: organs developed enough to (possibly) survive premature birth
    - sensitive to both light and sound

        #### The Learning Petus
        - ___DeCasper & Fifer (1980)___ : read ___cat in the Hat___ aloud 2x daily for 6 weeks before giving birth
            - immediately after birth: babies given headphones, pacifier-like device
            - speed of pacifier sucking = hearing mom's voice vs. another woman
                - chose speed that produced mom's voice
                - chose speed that produced mom's ___Cat in the Hat___ cs. another story

## Threats to Prenatal Development: ___Environment & Genetics___
- __environmental threats__
    - teratogen: agent that causes birth defects
        - ___e.g. hormones___
            - ___cortisol___ : stress hormone
                - high cortisol levels during pregnancy
                    -> growth genes operate slower
        - ___e.g. viruses___
        - ___e.g. radiation___
        - ___e.g. drug use___
            - nicotine -> lower birth weight, greater risk of SIDS
            - alcohol -> Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
                - intellectual disability, memory/attention deficits, stunted growth, facial abnormalities
- __genetic threats__
    - __Down syndrome (aka. trisomy 21)__
        - caused by 3rd copy of 21st chromosome
            - heart/eye/ear defects
            - sleep apnea
            - poor muscle tone, short limbs
            - facial abnormalities
            - intellectual disability (avg. IQ = 50-55)
        - 1 in 800-1000 births
        - age of mother critical?
            - __20-24 yrs__ : 1/1490 chance
            - __40 yrs__ : 1/60
            - __49 yrs__ : 1/11

## The Newborn
- traditional view -> incompetent, confused passive beings
- modern view -> active, engaged beings from birth
    - e.g. reflexes

## Brain Development
- ___prenatal___ : neural development
    - at peak, 250,000 new neurons per minute!
- ___newborns & children___ :
neural connections
    - development of neural networks
- ___adolescence___ : pruning process of neural connections

## Childgood Cognitive Development
<code>Do babies really know <u>___less___</u> than us, or do they know <u>___differently___</u> than us?</code>

- __Jean Piaget__ (1896-1980):
    - children as active thinkers, trying to understand experiences -> develop __schemas__
        - ___schema:___ concept/framework that helps organize & interpret info

## Schema Development: 2 Processes
1. ___assimilation:___ interpreting new experiences in terms of existing schemas
2. ___accomodation:___ adapting scehmas to incorporate new info

## Jean Piaget's Stage Model
- assimilation & accommodation -> schema development
- drives children through 4 stages of cognitive development
    - simple & tangible -> abstract & conceptual

    ### 1. Sensorimotor Stage
    - birth => age 2
    - world knowledge = sensory
    info, motor activites
    - development of ___object permanence:___ awareness that objects continue to exist when not perceived
        - ~~ 8months old
    - maybe even Piaget underestimated infants' cognitive competence?

    ### 2. Preoperational Stage
    - ages 2-7
    - ability to create
    ___mental___
    ___representations___

    - develop concept of ___conservation:___
    principle that quantity remains the same despite changes in shape

    #### Theory of Mind ####
    - ability to attribute mental states to yourself & others
        - allows us to:
            - infer feelings, perceptions, & thoughts
            - understand others, take their perspective, predict behavior
    - ___Jenkins & Astington (1996):___ ask what is in the Band-Aid box (actually pencils)
        - ___What would someone else guess if they had never seen this box before?___
            - ___3 yrs old:___ "pencils"
            - ___4-5 yrs old:___ "Band-Aids"

## Autism Spectrum Disorder
- brain development disorder, usually diagnosed in infancy based on behaviors:
    - no babbling/gesturing by 12 MO
    - no single words by 16 MO
    - no two-word phrases by 24 MO
    - 1-2 per 1000 births
    - 4-5x as communi~~

## 3 Classes of Autism Symptoms
1. ___social interaction impairments___
    - impaired theory of mind
        difficulty understanding emotions, considering others' viewpoints
    - little eye contact or smiling
    - unlikely to approach others
    - little nonverbal communication

2. ___communication impairments___
    - delayed onset of babbling
    - echolalia (repeating sounds)
    - difficulty understanding pointing

3. ___repetitive behaviors___
    - :useless" movements
    - preference for sameness, restricted behavior
    - self-injury (30%)
    - compulsive bhvrs (pattns, repetition, organization)

### Potential Causes of Autism
- ___disruptions to mirror neuron system?___
    - strong negative correlation btw <u>__mirror neuron activity__</u> and <u>__severity of autism smtoms__</u>
    - ___But autistic people can often imitate... And there are other non-mirror neural abnormalities too...___

## Failing to help
- ___bystander effect:___ the more people present at an emergency, the less likely that any one will help

## 5 Steps to Providing Help

3. assume responsibility
4. know appropriate form of help
5. provide help

## Helping behavior
- _Latane & Rodin (1969)_
    - __IV__: hear accident in another room __<u>alone/in a group of 3</u>__
    - __DV__: % who investigate the noise

- _Darley & Latane (1968)_
    - __IV__: overhear emergency while __<u>alone/with 1-4 witnesses in group__</u>

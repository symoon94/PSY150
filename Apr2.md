# Reminders about jean piaget


- 4 stage model of <u>cognitive development</u>
    - __Stage 1: sensorimotor stage (birth - 2YO)__
        - reality -= sensory input, motor movements
        - development of ___<u>object permanence</u>___
   - ~~ (pic)

    - __Stage 3: concrete operational stage__
        - ages 7-12
        - ability to engage in ___concrete operations__
            - manipulating mental representations of <u>concrete objects</u>
                - pizza jokes
            - emergence of reversibility
                - e.g. conservation

    - __Stage 4: formal operational stage__
        - age 12 - adulthood
        - expanding logical abilities
            - concrete (actual experience) -> formal (abstract, imagined realities & symbols)
            - ___"what is"___ vs. ___"what could be"___
                - e.g. 2x + 5 = 15
            - not necessarily reality-bound
                - enjoy hypothetical cognitive challenges?

    ### concrete vs. formal operational stages
    - Shaffer (1973): tested <u>__concrete/formal__</u> operators
        - concrete: 9-10 yr old 4th graders
        - formal: 11-12

        - 9-10 year olds
            - all put third eye on forehead, between 2 natural eyes
            - concrete experience: eyes appear around middle of face
        - rationale?
            - Jim (9 1/2): I would like an eye beside my other two eyes so that if one eye went out, I could still see with two.
            - (필기 못함. 예시)
        - 11-12 year olds
            - wide variety of responses; unique locations
            - thinking abstractly, outside the box
        - rationale?
        (pic)

        - enjoyment of assignment?
            - 9year olds: silly, uninteresting
                - _This is stupid. Nobdy has three eyes_
            - 11-12 year olds: enjoyed assignment; pestered teacher for rest of the year to do "fun" at assignments "like the eye problem"
        - formal operations -> ability & enjoyment of hypothetical, abstract reasoning

# Childhood social development
- social preferences from birth
    - turn toward human voices
    - gaze longer at face-like patterns
- ___attachment:___ emotional tie with another person

# Origins of attachment: body contact
- __Harry & Margaret Harlow:__ 1950s research on learning in monkeys
    - attachment to baby blankets in cages
    - _Why get attached to blankets_

# Attachment: Nourishment vs. Body contact
- 2 artificial "mothers"
    - bare wire cylinder with wooden head vs. wrapped in terry cloth
- __IV:__ nourishment from __<u>wire/cloth</u>__ "mother"
- strong preference for cloth mother for both groups
- similar importance of body contact for humans
    - stronger attachment to rocking/feeding/patting parents

# origins of attachment: familiarity
- many species attach to those experienced during critical period
    - e.g. first moving object ducklings see = mother
        - (pic)

- ___imprinting:___ process by which certain animals form attachments during critical period very early in life
    - Konrad Lorenz (1937):
    ___What if <u>he</u> was the first creature ducklings saw?___

# Attachment styles
- 1. ___secure attachment___
    - ~~ 65% of 1 YO
    - active exploration when AF present
    - upset by separations from AF, but warm greeting upon return
- 2. ___resistant attachment___
    - ~~ 10% of 1 YO
    - stay close to AF, little exploration
    - very distressed by separation
        - upon return: ambivalence
- 3. ___avoidant attachment___
    - ~~ 20 % of 1 YO
    - little distress upon separation from AF

- 4. ___disorganized/disoriented attachment___
    - ~~ 5-10% of 1 YO
    - resistant & avoidant styles combined

# Kohlberg's 3 stage model of moral development
1. ___preconventional stage:___ morality of self-interest
